% PROTOCOLS
%
% Protocol mfiles are used to control experiments. They are run by the main
% control window, and generally open up several of their own windows. They
% have a common function signature and respond to "actions" sent by the
% main function in a predictable way. Consult PROTOCOLTEMPLATE for more
% information on how to implement your own protocols.
