
In this directory are two kinds of files, headers and defaults. Header
files provide empty structures that define a "class". The mfiles should
be named according to the form <classname>_struct.m.  Defaults also return
structures, but are generally checked when initializing an object or
uicontrol. If the default file exists (filenames <classname>_default.m),
SET() should be called after creating the object.
