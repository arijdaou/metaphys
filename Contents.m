% METAPHYS
%
% METAPHYS is a MATLAB toolkit for data acquisition. It interfaces with the
% MATLAB data acquisition toolkit and provides a variety of graphical user
% interfaces for accessing digitizers and channels and for controlling
% input and output of data to digitizers and external programs.
%
% METAPHYS is organized around the concept of "virtual instruments", which
% are a collection of input, output, and telegraph channels. Accessing
% these channels is accomplied through functions in the DAQ subdirectory.
%
% METAPHYS provides access to data across the package through a global
% control structure. This structure includes user-defined parameters as
% well as parameters that are linked to matlab (or java or activex) UI
% objects. These parameters are accessed through functions in the UTILITY
% subdirectory.
